# Font Files

Place your custom font files here:

1. **That_That_New_Pixel_Test.ttf** - For the main title "WELCOME TO Y^2"
2. **Belmonte_Ballpoint_Trial.ttf** - For the large background "Y" 
3. **PP_NeueBit.ttf** - For the button text "SIGN UP / LOG IN"

## Important Notes:
- The app will crash if these fonts are missing
- Make sure the filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- After adding fonts, run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`

## Font Sources:
- You'll need to obtain these fonts from their respective sources
- Make sure you have proper licensing for commercial use
