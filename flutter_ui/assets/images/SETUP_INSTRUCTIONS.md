# Image Setup Instructions

## Background Image for Create Account Screen

1. **Save the landscape image** you provided as `background_landscape.jpg` in this folder
   - The image should be the green field with white clouds and blue sky
   - Make sure the filename is exactly `background_landscape.jpg` (case-sensitive)

2. **Delete the placeholder file** `background_landscape.jpg` (the text file) and replace it with your actual image

3. **Run Flutter commands** to refresh assets:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Test the app** - The Create Account screen should now show your landscape background
